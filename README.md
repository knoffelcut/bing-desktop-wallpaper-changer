# Bing Desktop Wallpaper Changer
Automatically downloads and changes desktop wallpaper to Bing Photo of the Day.

This is a fork of the archived repo [Bing Desktop Wallpaper Changer](https://github.com/UtkarshGpta/bing-desktop-wallpaper-changer).
Updates and modifications include:
- Use [ArbSR-cpu](https://github.com/knoffelcut/ArbSR-cpu) to upscale from 1080p/HD to higher resolutions (e.g. QHD, 4k(untested)).
- Remove Python2 support.
- Migrate from os.path to pathlib.
- Check for internet connection, instead of constant wait.
- Fix some bugs where gnome functions is used for cinnamon DEs.

## Synopsis
Python Script for automatically downloading and changing the desktop wallpaper to Bing Photo of the day. The script runs automatically at the startup and works on GNU/Linux with Gnome or Cinnamon. Works perfectly on Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

## What does it do?
It grabs images exactly the same way *Microsoft* uses to put it up on its page - using **XML/RSS/JSON**. You can't scrape the website directly. After searching on the internet for long I found out the link - *http://www.bing.com/HPImageArchive.aspx?format=xml&idx=0&n=1&mkt=en-US*

Here we can get data in any of the formats but substituting the value of **format=[value]** in the link.

**idx** denotes the *day before the current day*. idx=0 means current day, idx=1 means yesterday and so on.
**n** is an integer denoting the *number of days before the day denoted by idx*. It grabs data about all the n number of images.
**mkt** denotes the *area*. The script will try to match your locale to one of the supported Bing Market areas, falling back to 'en-US' if it fails to do so. You can also force a particular market area (see list of valid markets in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd251064.aspx) in the config file:

```
~/.config/bing-desktop-wallpaper-changer/config.ini
```

Example:

```ini
[market]
# If you want to override the current Bing market detection,
# set your preferred market here. For a list of markets, see
# https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd251064.aspx
area = 'bg-BG'
```

To force your area to be 'bg-BG' (Bulgarian - Bulgaria).

All the wallpapers are stored in '**/home/[user]/Pictures/BingWallpapers/**'
